# Clarity_Evaluator
This repository contains files for a R Shiny app.
The app is intended to allow users to predict non-attainment rates (over a 5-year assessment period) of water quality criteria.
Users can alter the criteria magnitude and frequency components, and explore how non-attainment rates would change.
