# Clarity_Evaluator
This repository contains files for a R Shiny app.
The app is intended to allow users to predict non-attainment rates (over a 5-year assessment period) of water quality criteria.
Users can alter the criteria magnitude and frequency components, and explore how non-attainment rates would change.
The file in this directory are as follows:

server.R     : the server code for the app
ui. R        : the user interface file for the app
Middle Marsh.csv   : an example data file of seasonal median KD by year, formatted as needed for the app.
